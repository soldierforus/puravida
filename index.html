																	<p>I have worked with Sharon for approximately 18 months, during which time she has acted as the property manager/ concierge for my condominium, which is rented out as an AirBnb.

																		If given the opportunity, we would purchase another property and have her manage it without a second thought. Her business savvy and knowledge of the industry has made working with her a very lucrative venture for both of us. ”
